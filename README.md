Titanic Mini Dataset - EDA

About this Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key steps completed:

Dataset creation with features: age, fare, pclass, sex, survived.

Data inspection using .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts().

Visualizations: histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to explore patterns.

Observations were written for each plot.

A PDF summary was generated highlighting the main findings.
